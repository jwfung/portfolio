            Welcome to the part of this site where I get to share random tibits of myself! 
            For formalities sake, Iâ€™m a soon-to-be grad (whoo!) at The Johns Hopkins University 
            where I studied Cognitive Science (with a focus in Linguistics), Computer Science, and Visual Arts.  
          </p> 
          <p>
            I am interested in discovering how we can create human-centric design for good, a question which I believe requires continuous education and iterations. 
            During a previous internship with MassDOT, I became particularly interested in universal design and how we can better our world for people of all abilities. 
          </p> 
          <p>
            Over the years, I've been given an amazing opportunity to study abroad in China, South Korea, 
            and The Netherlands. It has given me a unique perspective on how different cultures do things, 
            inspiring me to think outside-of-the-box and questioning the status-quo. 
            This has also led me to a random niche I really enjoy exploring: Urban Design and how we can create more people-first cities. 
            I also love learning new languages, mostly so I can see the overlaps and evolution between different languages first hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy adventuring by foot, and exploring new hobbies, like aerial trapeze and dragon-boat racing!
            I also enjoy anything hands-on, like painting and sewing. Check out some of my work below!
